            <p class="p1">"Frankie", "Ginger", "Mo", "Red". These are a few of the things I have been called over the years. Growing up as a red-headed only child, life was always very exciting! I was born in Texas, grew up in North Carolina, and played every sport
                imaginable. I definitely wasn't the world's greatest athlete, but I wasn't the worst either, so that's a win in my book. I was an avid dancer and went on to study apparel design and business at Virginia Tech. </p>
            <br>
            <p class="p2">As my hair grew darker, and the day-walking, soul stealing ginger jokes I had grown fond of tapered off, I delved into the world of E-Commerce photography and moved to Baltimore, MD. I have since worked as a Stylist in three different studios
                in three different states (taxes have been a blast!) After spending roughly four years creating content for websites, I have decided to get a better understanding of the actual development process; and here I am!</p>
